    <h2>You have now entered the Decision Stage</h2> 
    <p>
      In the following task, we will ask you to repeatedly choose between the two options you just explored. Now the outcomes of each decision count towards your final payoff.
      You will have to pay {{ switching_cost }} points to switch between options. That means if you select a button, different from the one you selected 
      in the previous round, this cost will be deducted from your total payoff. 
      You can also gain information about the option that you are not choosing in the next trial by paying {{ information_cost }} points
      by checking the little box that says "See all payoffs".
