      In the following task, we will ask you to repeatedly choose between two options. The options are the two buttons below. 
      Each button has different outcomes. The outcomes count towards your final payoff.
      You will have to pay {{ switching_cost }} to switch between options. That means if you select a button, different from the one you selected 
      in the previous round, this cost will be deducted from your total payoff. 
      You can also gain information about the option that you are not choosing in the next trial by paying {{ information_cost }} and checking the little box that says "See all payoffs".
