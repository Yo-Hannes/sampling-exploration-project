This experiment consists of two stages: explore and exploit stage. In the explore stage the player can explore for as many rounds as she wants.
Leaving the explore stage, the exploitation stage starts. The exploitation stage is 100 trials long. Here the player can choose between A and B, 
receives feedback about the choosen alternative and can receive information about the forgone payoff for an fee (FIC = forgone information cost). The player can switch between 
A and B, but this comes at an additional cost (SWC = switchting cost)
