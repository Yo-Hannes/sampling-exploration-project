    <p>
      In the following task, we will ask you to repeatedly choose between two options. The options are the two buttons below. 
      Each button has different outcomes. The outcomes count towards your final payoff. Before you have to choose between between the buttons 
      counting towards your payoff, you can explore the outcomes for each button as long as you want. At the bottom of the page you see the button "Done Sampling". 
      You can press this button to switch from the sampling to the payoff phase. 
      You will have to pay {{ switching_cost }} to switch between options in the payoff phase. 
      In the payoff phase, you can also gain information about the option that you are not choosing in the next trial by paying {{ information_cost }}.
