    <h2>Instruction</h2> 
    <p>
      In this task you will have to decide between two buttons shown below. Each button provides different outcomes. 
      During the task, you will be able to check the outcomes by clicking on the buttons.  
    </p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row" style="text-align: center;">   
    <div class="row">
    {% for image in symbols %}
      <div class="col-md-6" style="text-align: center;">
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="{{ static image }}" width="200px" class="response-btn" index = {{ forloop.counter0 }} id="{{image}}" onclick="pick_response(this)">
          <div class="payoff-text" index = {{ forloop.counter0 }} onclick="pick_response(this)"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
</div>

    The task has <strong>two stages</strong>. You will first get to know the outcomes of the buttons in the <strong>sampling stage</strong>. When you think
    you learnt enough about the outcomes and feel ready, you will be able to terminate the sampling stage. Then in the
    second stage, the <strong>decision stage</strong>, you will be asked to choose between the same buttons repeatedly for many trials. The
    outcomes you get in the decision stage will determine your bonus payment. We will now provide you with more details
    about the stages of the task. Afterwards, we will ask you some questions to make sure the instructions were understood. 
    Please continue by clicking the next button.
